These values are later interpreted as a color.\n","\n","For example, in Figure 1, we would be describing two colors (black and white) and we could describe them using 1's and 0's. In general, 0 is taken to mean the absence of color, which means that 0 = black and 1 = white. Putting these ideas together, we can see that each point in an image requires three peices of information:\n","\n","\n","1.   x - position\n","2.   y - position\n","3.   color (1 or 0)\n","\n","So if we were instructing a computer to produce even a small image, we would need to give it a large list of numbers.\n","\n","---\n","![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/fU7Yfre.png)\n","\n","*Figure 2:* Checker board pattern\n","\n","For example, suppose we wanted the computer to produce the checkboard patter that we see in Figure 2. If we make a list of the information the computer needs, we can format it like (x-coordinate, y-coordinate, color) and the whole list would be\n","\n","(1,1,1), (1,2,0), (1,3,1), (2,1,0), (2,2,1), (2,3,0), (3,1,1), (3,2,0), (3,3,1)\n","\n","---\n","![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/ZraCTP1.png)\n","\n","*Figure 3:* Images\n","\n","To make the image making process easier, people decided to ditch the traditional coordinate system and use matricies instead! However, because both systems *work* and because sometimes one method can be more convenient than the other, both still exists, but they have different names. \n","\n","When you use a coordinate system to instruct the computer, that's a **scatter plot**. When you use a matrix, that's called an **image**.\n","\n","To instruct the computer to make a scatter plot of the 9 square checkerboard, we had to give it 3x9=27 numbers. To insturct it to make an image of the checkerboard, we only have to give it 9 numbers, but they have to be in the correct *order*. Specifically, the order looks like this:\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","image = [ [1, 0, 1],\n","          [0, 1, 0],\n","          [1, 0, 1] ]\n","```\n","\n","Each location that we assign a value to is considered a pixel. Thus, we have created an image that is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall, and it has a total  of 9 pixels.\n","\n","When we watch youtube videos at 1080p, we are actually looking at pictures that are 1080 pixels tall and 1920 pixel wide. These images have a total of 1080x1920 = 2,073,600â€¬ pixels. If we round to the nearest million, there are approximately 2 million pixels in each image. This would be considered a 2 Mega Pixel (MP) image.
