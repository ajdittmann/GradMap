# Google Collab

Collab integration seems to be as straightforward as uploading a given ipython notebook to google drive an clicking on it. It might be as simple as
creating a folder in drive with all of the student versions and sharing it with them ahead of time. We could later share solutions the same way. 
If we'd like to go this route, the main difficulty will be handling things like loading in external files, but that can be solved without too much effort. 
Syncing things between google drive and github could also be challenging (one solution could be to only change version, and copy it into the other).
For now, the notebooks can be found on collab [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oyVnQJp5cFPADaYfl_tSWwdebJWZUgOy) (if we go this route, it would probably be good to host in a GRADMAP drive rather than mine) - Alex

1. Download the GradMap repository at https://github.com/astroumd/GradMap using the green "Clone or Download" button (and click Download ZIP).
2. Once the file is downloaded, unzip it and make sure the folder ends up in your Downloads folder.

Mac users: 
1. Open up the Terminal application navigate to the folder using `cd Downloads/GradMap-master`
1. Type the command `jupyter notebook`. Your default web browser should open a list of files in your Downloads folder.
2. Navigate to the Lectures 2020 folder. Click on any lecture and it will open up the Jupyter notebook.

PC users:
1. Open up the command prompt (follow instructions here: https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089)
2. Navigate to the folder using `cd Downloads/GradMap-master`.
1. Type the command `jupyter notebook`. Your default web browser should open a list of files in your Downloads folder.
2. Navigate to the Lectures 2020 folder. Click on any lecture and it will open up the Jupyter notebook.

Anaconda Navigator (both Mac and PC):
